# LuaTypeFramework
TypeFramework is a framework that helps you to have a more organized code, and more beautiful with functionalities that the pure Lua don't have!

Based on C/C++ syntax

Here goes the skeleton of a Lua TypeFramework code:
```lua
local TypeFramework = require('TypeFramework')
TypeFramework:Load() --> load functions

function main()
  process.utils.log('Hello, world!')
end

TypeFramework:Init() --> init functions
```
